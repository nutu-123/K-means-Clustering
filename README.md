# K-means-Clustering
In this mini project, I performed unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm on a Heart Disease dataset. The goal was to group similar patient records based on medical attributes without using target labels. 
I used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters and evaluated the clustering quality using the Silhouette Score. For better visualization, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was used to reduce the dataset to two dimensions and plot the clusters clearly.
